# Do not find the fox: a calculation

I found this game by [Alex Cheddar](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexCheddarUK) called [do not find the fox](https://donotfindthefox.com/) and got curious as to how to calculate the chance of winning the game.

Went into a rabbit hole on how to generate permutations and learned many new things.

This code is purely for my own education.
